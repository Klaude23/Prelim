<i>Born and raised in Gothenburg, Kjellberg registered his YouTube channel "PewDiePie" in 2010, primarily posting Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel gained a substantial following and was one of the fastest growing channels in 2012 and 2013, before becoming the most-subscribed on YouTube on 15 August 2013. From 29 December 2014 to 14 February 2017, Kjellberg's channel was also the most-viewed on the platform. During this period, his content shifted focus from Let's Plays and diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. In 2016, Time magazine named him as one of the world's 100 most influential people. His popularity online was also noted to boost sales for the titles he plays, and has allowed him to stir support for charity fundraising drives.</body><p></i>

<h2> Personal Life </h2>
<p>
<i>Kjellberg married his long-time Italian girlfriend Marzia Bisognin on 19 August 2019. The two were introduced to each other through a friend of Bisognin's in 2011, and after establishing an online relationship, Kjellberg flew to Italy to meet her. The pair shuffled between Sweden and Italy, before settling in Brighton, England.Kjellberg explained that they moved to the UK in July 2013 for preference to live close to the sea and for better Internet connectivity. He said he enjoyed the general anonymity that living in Brighton granted him.

A 2018 trip to Japan inspired Kjellberg to move to the country. Announcing their intention to permanently move there, Kjellberg and his wife subsequently bought a home in Japan the following year. The home was robbed in late 2019, and the couple's move was delayed due to Japan restricting relocation regulations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In May 2022, Kjellberg and his wife moved to their home in Japan with a 5-year business visa. After moving to Japan, Kjellberg expressed enjoying a lack of recognition while in public.</i>
